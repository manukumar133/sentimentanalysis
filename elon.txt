Here are some of the interventions from political and tech industry figures – as well as King
Charles – on the day.
Elon Musk
The world’s richest man and Tesla chief executive described AI as a threat to humanity.

Musk, who co-founded the ChatGPT developer OpenAI, has launched a new venture called xAI and is attending
both days of the summit, which is being held about 50 miles from London at the site which played host to top-secret
codebreakers during the second world war.

Describing AI as “one of the biggest threats to humanity”, Musk said: “I mean, for the first time, we have a
 situation where there’s something that is going to be far smarter than the smartest human. So, you know, we’re not
 stronger or faster than other creatures, but we are more intelligent. And here we are, for the first time really in
 human history, with something that’s going to be far more intelligent than us.”

In comments to the PA news agency on the summit sidelines, he said it was “not clear we can control such a thing”,
 but “we can aspire to guide it in a direction that’s beneficial to humanity”.
